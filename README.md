# Pokémon XD: DX [Director's Cut]

Pokémon XD: DX [Director’s Cut] is a feature-rich romhack that keeps the original story intact but transforms the entire experience. Trainer teams have been completely reworked, nearly every Pokémon line is obtainable, and Pokemon Stats, Abilities and Movesets have been overhauled to keep battles fresh. DX embraces the Shadow Pokémon theme with a darker, stylized aesthetic and a stronger focus on variety and challenge. While not a “vanilla” replay, DX builds on the foundations of Gale of Darkness and XG: Next Gen to provide a more dynamic and enjoyable experience for long-time fans of the series.

**Please Note:**  
THIS ROMHACK IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MODERN POKÉMON GAMES.  
YOU CANNOT TRANSFER POKÉMON UP TO CURRENT GAMES.  
PLEASE DO NOT ASK ABOUT THIS.

Hi, I'm **SuperPep**.

After over 5 years, and more than 1000+ hours of development I am proud to present **Pokémon XD: DX [Director's Cut]**.

> _A feature-rich Pokémon XD romhack with many modern improvements, accentuated stylization, and lots of love and care._  
> Pokémon fill new roles in the meta, and you can rest easy knowing your favorite Pokémon will be at their absolute BEST in this romhack.

I love competitive Pokémon, so this romhack is catered to people who like what I like, good old-fashioned double battling with fun moves and strategies.  
_(Note: hmu if you're tryna battle in the mainline games!)_

I would hesitate to call this romhack **hard**, as your Pokémon gain a lot of power, but there will likely be times this romhack challenges you, especially late-game and post-game.

A full list of all the changes can be found in the **Features** section below.

**Please Note:**  
If you are a Pokémon purist/traditionalist, this romhack may not be for you.  
There are several creative liberties taken, a handful of fakemon, and aesthetic design choices which I personally think add up to create the best possible way to play Pokémon XD in 2025.  
Additionally, 90% of the game has been completely overhauled, so this is NOT a vanilla experience be aware that ***it will not try to be***.

This project would not have even remotely been possible without the groundwork laid out by **StarsMMD** and all the lovely people over in the NGC/Wii Pokémon Romhacking Community.  
Thank you all so much for your help. If you or a friend are interested in NGC/Wii Pokémon Romhacking, come join us in the Discord — we have a lot of fun there!

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I randomize DX [Director's Cut]?</strong></summary>
  DX is not designed to be randomized, nor will I introduce any further support for randomized runs.  
  Pokémon that were removed have had their UI portraits replaced and will appear incorrectly on a randomized run.  

  Instead of randomizing the game, I would recommend experimenting with the multitude of new teambuilding options, and trying fresh runs using new teams.  
  Be aware that randomizing DX will ruin the highly tailored battling experience, and you do so at your own expense.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is DX [Director's Cut] compatible with texture packs?</strong></summary>
  Unless you can find one that replaces <strong>all</strong> of the textures I updated, you will likely run into a significant amount of visual bugs.  
  So not really. I did a full UI overhaul for a reason!
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I use cheats on DX [Director's Cut]?</strong></summary>
  Short answer is <strong>no</strong>.  

  Long answer: many of the Pokémon XD cheats can and will break parts of the DX [Director's Cut] code and cause unknown issues, including corrupted saves and endless crashes.  
  If you put a cheat in and something looks broken, that's probably why.  
  If your save gets corrupted, you will have to start a new game.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I edit my DX [Director's Cut] save file?</strong></summary>
  Short answer is <strong>no</strong>.  

  DX is not compatible with most save editors, including PKHeX and PKHax. These will cause unintended issues, and most likely, won't work at all.  

  Several tutorials have been created online for editing XG: Next Gen save data, and these can sometimes be used to edit DX save data.  
  But ultimately, I wouldn't recommend it — it’s more of a headache than it’s worth.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I play this in widescreen?</strong></summary>
  No. It's meant to be played in its original aspect ratio (4:3).  
  There will be black bars on both the left and right side of the screen.  

  You <em>can</em> scale it up to a higher resolution (6x–8x recommended) to get a crisp image.  
  But using widescreen cheats or hacks may cause unintended behaviors and crashes — do so at your own risk.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What happened to Battle CDs?</strong></summary>
  Battle CDs and anything related to them have been completely removed from the game for various reasons.  
  They will likely not be added back in.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What happened to Battle Bingo?</strong></summary>
  Battle Bingo was also removed completely due to various issues.  
  It will likely not be returning, though the likelihood it returns is higher than Battle CDs.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I play DX on GameCube / Official Hardware?</strong></summary>
  DX has not been tested on real hardware.  
  Please test and report back with your findings!
</details>
